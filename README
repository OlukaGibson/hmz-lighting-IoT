# HMZ IoT LED Controller (ESP32)

This project is an IoT LED controller based on the ESP32-S3, designed for addressable LEDs such as WS2812B and SK6812. It provides wireless control and configuration via BLE and stores device/network settings in SPIFFS.

## Features

- **Addressable LED Control:** Supports WS2812B, SK6812, and similar LEDs.
- **BLE Communication:** Acts as a BLE peripheral for phone app control.
- **Config Storage:** Device and network configuration stored in SPIFFS as JSON.
- **Dynamic MAC Address:** Automatically detects and stores device MAC.
- **LED Themes:** Supports solid color, rainbow, breathe, theater chase, and color wipe animations.
- **Runtime Adjustments:** Change brightness, speed, and animation via BLE commands.
- **WiFi Config Sync:** Store multiple WiFi credentials for future OTA/cloud features.

## File Structure

- `src/` - Main application code
- `lib/` - Modular libraries (BLE, device config, LED controller, etc.)
- `platformio.ini` - PlatformIO build configuration
- `README` - Project description

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware:** ESP32-S3 board, addressable LED strip (WS2812B/SK6812), optional sensors.
2. **Software:** PlatformIO, Arduino framework.
3. **Build & Upload:** Use PlatformIO to build and upload firmware.
4. **BLE App:** Connect via a BLE app to send commands and configure devices.

## Example JSON Configuration

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_name": "LEDStrip1",
      "device_type": "strip",
      "led_type": "WS2812B",
      "num_of_leds": 30,
      "mac_address": "00:11:22:33:44:55"
    }
  ],
  "networks": [
    {
      "ssid": "HomeNetwork",
      "password": "password123"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Plans

- OTA updates via WiFi
- Web dashboard for configuration
- MQTT integration
- Time-based LED themes
